Deep Learning Introduction:
1.Deep Learning defines about the working of complex neural networking.This topic is a subset of the Machine Learning.

Types of Layers in Deep Learning:

1.Input Layer:
Receives the raw data to the machines

2.Hidden Layer:
Perform the computations in the hidden layer which is process the data.

3.Output Layer:
Provide the final output in DeepLearning

Activation function in Deep Learning:

1.ReLU: 
(Rectified Linear Unit)
which is used to the hidden layers to show the data in the gradient of the data and which is simply used in speeding up during the training of the data.

2.Sigmoid:
map the values binary (0 and 1 in the layer)

3.Softmax:
cover the raw data into (score) convert into the probability in the given data.

back propagation and optimisation:
in this propagation step we use some of the example MSE(means standard error),cross entropy stop: which optimises the data.
